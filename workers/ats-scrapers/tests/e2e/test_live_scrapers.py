"""Live end-to-end scraper tests — real tenants, real HTTP.

Opt in with ``ATS_SCRAPERS_LIVE_E2E=1``; select with ``-m live``:

    ATS_SCRAPERS_LIVE_E2E=1 pytest -m live -q

Covers one representative tenant per major source. Big always-hiring
boards assert a non-empty result; small long-tail tenants only assert
that the fetch round-trips (their boards may be legitimately empty).
The nightly ``live-e2e`` workflow runs this suite so scraper drift
(an ATS changing its API) surfaces within a day, not when a user
reports it.
